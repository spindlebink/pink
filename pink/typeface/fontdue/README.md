# Fontdue Odin

Bindings to [Fontdue Native](https://codeberg.org/spindlebink/fontdue-native) in the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org).

* [Codeberg repo](https://codeberg.org/spindlebink/fontdue-odin)
* [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/spindlebink/fontdue-odin)

## Status

The bindings are complete, but I've only tested anything on Linux. I don't have a Windows dev system, so the `foreign import` isn't present for Windows.

If you use Windows, feel free to fork and PR to load the Windows library + test to ensure it works.
