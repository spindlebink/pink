# Pink

A WIP game framework in [the Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org) modeled after [LÖVE](https://love2d.org).

**This is not currently usable.** It's primarily a learning project. The code may be messy, unsafe, less-than-fully-designed, and in most places missing or non-functional.
