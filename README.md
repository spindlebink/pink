A WIP game framework in [the Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org) modeled after [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org).

**This is not currently usable.** It's primarily a learning project. The code may be messy, unsafe, less-than-fully-designed, and in most places missing or non-functional.

I'm following [the Vulkan tutorial here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction) to learn Vulkan in an effort to eventually write a renderer.
